Coffee Shop Backend with Spring and Postman Testing
This is a backend application for a coffee shop built using Spring framework, with Postman testing. This application is built with a focus on applying 2 SOLID principles, clean code, and dependency injection.

Features
The Coffee Shop backend application provides the following features:

User authentication and authorization
CRUD operations for managing products, orders, and customers
Integration with external payment gateway using REST API
API endpoints for retrieving statistics and reports

SOLID Principles
The application applies 2 SOLID principles:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class has a single responsibility and does it well
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions
Clean Code
The application follows clean code principles, including:

Meaningful variable and method names
Consistent formatting and indentation
Avoidance of code duplication
Appropriate use of comments and documentation
Testing
The application is tested using Postman, with a collection of test cases covering all API endpoints and scenarios. Testing includes both positive and negative scenarios, and edge cases.

Installation
To run the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository
Open the project in your IDE
Build and run the application using mvn spring-boot:run
Open Postman and import the collection of test cases
Run the test cases to verify the application functionality
