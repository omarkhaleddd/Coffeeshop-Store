<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Coffee Shop Backend with Spring and Postman Testing</h2>

This is a backend application for a coffee shop built using Spring framework, with Postman testing. This application is built with a focus on applying 2 SOLID principles, clean code, and dependency injection.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Features</h2>

The Coffee Shop backend application provides the following features:
<ul>
  <li> User authentication and authorization</li>
  <li>CRUD operations for managing products, orders, and customers</li>
  <li> Integration with external payment gateway using REST API</li>
  <li> API endpoints for retrieving statistics and reports</li>  
</ul>
<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">SOLID Principles</h2>

The application applies 2 SOLID principles:
<ul>
  <li> Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class has a single responsibility and does it well</li>
  <li> Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules, both should depend on abstractions</li>
</ul>


<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Clean Code</h2>

The application follows clean code principles, including:
<ul>
  <li> Meaningful variable and method names</li>
  <li> Consistent formatting and indentation</li>
  <li> Avoidance of code duplication</li>
  <li> Appropriate use of comments and documentation</li>  
</ul>


<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Testing</h2>
The application is tested using Postman, with a collection of test cases covering all API endpoints and scenarios. Testing includes both positive and negative scenarios, and edge cases.

<h2 style="font-size: 24px;">Installation</h2>

1. Clone the repository

2. Open the project in your IDE
 
3. Build and run the application using mvn spring-boot:run
